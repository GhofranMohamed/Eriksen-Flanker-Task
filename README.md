# FSL analysis on flanker data set
## Problem definition: 
Eriksen flanker task is a set of tests to assess selective attention and inhibitory function. In this task the target is positioned in the center and is flanked by a nontarget stimuli. The individual is requested to press either the left or wright arrow key depending on the target direction.
The task contains three types of nontarget stimuli:
1.	The congruent, here target is in the same direction as the nontarget.
2.	The incongruent, target is in the opposite direction.
3.	The neutral, target is neither the same nor the opposite direction.

The data set contains FMRI recording for 26 subjects, each has an anatomical record and functional record which has two runs. 
What are we trying to do?
We want to analyze these data set by first applying enhancing, standardization, generalization and statistical methods to find the ROI.
## ROI 
The brain regions which are activated during each stimuli of the task.
